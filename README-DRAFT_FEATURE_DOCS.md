# 🚧 Draft Feature Implementation

The draft feature has been successfully implemented in your Astro blog application. This document explains how it works and how to use it.

## 📋 **Overview**

The draft system allows you to:
- ✅ Create posts that are visible in development but hidden in production
- ✅ Preview draft content with clear visual indicators
- ✅ Automatically filter drafts from public listings
- ✅ Seamlessly transition from draft to published

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Production Behavior**
- Draft posts are **completely hidden**
- Not included in blog listings
- Not accessible via direct URLs
- Search engines cannot index them
- RSS feeds exclude draft posts

### **Development Behavior**
- Draft posts are **visible for preview**
- Clear visual indicators show draft status
- Full functionality for testing
- Easy identification with badges and styling

## 🚀 **Usage Guide**

### **Creating a Draft Post**
Add `draft: true` to your post's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My New Post"
description: "Post description"
date: 2025-10-09
draft: true  # This makes it a draft
tags: ["example"]
---

Your post content here...
```

### **Publishing a Draft**
Remove the draft field or set it to false:

```yaml
---
title: "My New Post"
description: "Post description"
date: 2025-10-09
draft: false  # Or completely remove this line
tags: ["example"]
---
```
