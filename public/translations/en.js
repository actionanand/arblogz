  'about.me.title': 'About Me: Life Beyond the Code',
  'about.me.content': `Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a software developer by profession, but this space is dedicated to everything else that makes me who I am. Here, you won't find a single line of code or technical tutorial. Instead, this blog is my repository for life experiences, personal discoveries, and the quirky habits that shape my everyday existence.

![about-anand](/about-ar.jpg)

**Why This Blog Exists**: I wanted to create something different from the technical noise online. This is my digital diary for non-technical discoveries – life lessons, observations, and experiences that matter beyond work. Think of it as insights accessible to you and future me who might need these reminders.

**The Night Owl Chronicles**: Music is my constant companion during those late-night hours when the world goes quiet. I'm not tied to specific artists; what captures me are meaningful lyrics that resonate with life experiences. The night brings out my most creative thinking – there's something magical about silence that allows ideas to flow freely. I've been a creature of the night since childhood, often rushing to exams after studying until dawn.

**Life's Simple Pleasures**: I'm a Ludo enthusiast and devoted food lover with a serious weakness for authentic Hyderabadi biryani – a love affair that began in Delhi thanks to popular restaurant chains like Biryani Blues and Bikkgane Biryani. I've embarked on a biryani quest, sampling everything from Behrouz's Afghani-style to regional varieties like Ambur, Thalappakatti and Muradabadi. My food adventures extend to street food delights like momos, egg puffs, Kachodi, chaap, vada pav and pav bhaji, though I'll admit vegetarian food and I rarely see eye to eye.

**The Person I Am**: Organization is key to my sanity – everything has its designated place and must return there. I love green spaces and greenery, find joy in playing with kids, and believe in teaching others what I've learned. My laziness is actually my superpower, driving me to find the easiest permanent solutions for daily tasks. I even avoid writing with pens because I'm that committed to efficiency!

**My Philosophy**: I'm adaptable in relationships, mirroring the energy of those around me. I prefer inspiring others rather than seeking inspiration, and I live by a simple rule: as long as you're not harming others, whatever you do is valid. Trust and authenticity are non-negotiable in my friendships.

**What You Can Expect**: This blog will share my non-technical world – the lessons learned from everyday life, mistakes that taught me something valuable, and insights gained from simply being human. I welcome your thoughts and suggestions through the contact form. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you'll join me on this journey of life beyond the professional world!`,
  'about.other.title': 'Our Language Choices and Global Reach',
  'about.other.content': `As someone from Tamil Nadu, I am deeply proud to be a native Tamil speaker—Tamil is not just my mother tongue, but also a language with a rich heritage and global significance. Tamil stands as the world's oldest living classical language, with a history spanning over 5000 years. It is spoken by millions in South India and holds official status in countries like Sri Lanka and Singapore. This living legacy is a source of immense pride for me and for all who speak Tamil.

When selecting languages for translation on my blog, I made a conscious decision to focus on languages that are actively spoken by people today—living languages. While there are many ancient and classical languages with remarkable histories, some are no longer used for daily communication. My goal was to ensure accessibility and relevance for a broad, contemporary audience.

**English** was an essential choice, given its role as the global lingua franca and its widespread use in international communication, business, and technology.

**Chinese** (both Simplified and Traditional) was included due to its status as the most spoken language in the world, covering vast populations in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and overseas communities.

**Hindi** is spoken by a vast population across India, especially in regions where Hindi is the primary medium of communication (the northern part of India). Including Hindi ensures my content reaches a significant portion of the Indian population.

**Kannada** deserves special mention. As someone working in Bangalore, the heart of Karnataka, I wanted to give preference to the local language. Kannada is a major South Indian language with a rich literary tradition and millions of speakers. Its inclusion reflects both my personal connection to the region and my respect for its vibrant culture.

**French** was selected for its global reach, being spoken across Europe, Africa, North America, and parts of Asia. French is also a language of culture, diplomacy, and international relations.

**Czech** represents my commitment to European diversity, connecting with audiences in Central Europe and acknowledging the Czech Republic's vibrant culture and history.

**Arabic** was added for its importance across the Middle East and North Africa, as well as its role as a classical and living language with deep historical and religious significance.

In summary, the languages I chose—Tamil, English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Hindi, French, Czech, Arabic, and Kannada—are all living languages, actively spoken by millions around the world. Tamil, Kannada and Hindi are three of the 22 official languages in India. While I honor the legacy of ancient languages, my focus is on those that continue to connect people today, ensuring my blog is accessible, relevant, and inclusive for a truly global audience.`,
