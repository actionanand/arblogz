# Color Highlighting Test

Let's test the simple color highlighting feature:

This is normal text, but ==this is red|#ff0000== and ==this is blue|#0066cc==.

You can also try ==green text|#28a745== and ==yellow background|#ffc107==.

Multiple colors in one line: ==red|#dc3545== and ==blue|#007bff== and ==green|#28a745==.

## How to Use

The syntax is simple: `==text|color==`

Examples:
