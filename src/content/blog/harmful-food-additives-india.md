Packaged foods, ice creams, drinks, and juices in India often contain synthetic additives and chemicals. These improve shelf life, texture, color, and taste, but some may have health risks if consumed regularly or in large amounts.

##  Harmful Food Additives Overview 

Some commonly found harmful additives in Indian packaged foods include artificial colors (like Tartrazine), preservatives (such as Sodium Benzoate), and flavor enhancers (such as Monosodium Glutamate). These additives can be found in snacks, beverages, and processed foods, and may pose health risks if consumed in large quantities.

###  What to Watch Out For 

- **Artificial colors:** Tartrazine (E102), Sunset Yellow (E110), Carmoisine (E122), Allura Red (E129)
- **Preservatives:** Sodium Benzoate (E211), Potassium Sorbate (E202), Benzoic Acid (E210), Sulphites (E220â€“E228)
- **Flavor enhancers:** Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, E621), Disodium Inosinate (E631), Disodium Guanylate (E627)
- **Sweeteners:** Aspartame (E951), Saccharin (E954), Cyclamates (E952), Sucralose (E955)
- **Antioxidants:** TBHQ (E319), BHA (E320), BHT (E321)
- **Emulsifiers:** Polysorbate 80 (E433), Mono- and Diglycerides (E471)
- **Other chemicals:** Propylene Glycol (E1520), Aluminium Compounds (E173, E554)

##  More Harmful Items to Avoid 

- **Artificial fruit and vanilla flavors:** Vanillin, ethyl vanillin, benzaldehyde, methyl anthranilate
- **Synthetic butter flavor:** Diacetyl
- **High fructose corn syrup (HFCS):** Used in sweets and drinks, linked to obesity and diabetes
- **Palmolein and palm oil:** Used in snacks and bakery, high intake linked to heart disease
- **Artificial chocolate flavor:** Used in cakes and ice creams, may cause allergies
- **Aluminium compounds:** Used in sweets and bakery, may affect the nervous system
- **Propylene glycol:** Used in ice creams and bakery, may cause irritation in large doses

##  Nutrition to Be Careful Of in Packed Foods 

When consuming packaged foods, also pay attention to these nutritional components:

:::caution
Saturated fats have single carbon bonds and are typically solid at room temperature, found in foods like butter and red meat, while **trans fats are artificially produced unsaturated fats** that have undergone hydrogenation to become solid or semi-solid. Saturated fats raise LDL (bad) cholesterol but also HDL (good) cholesterol, whereas trans fats significantly increase LDL and decrease HDL, making them more harmful to heart health
:::

- **Trans Fats:** Often found in baked goods, snacks, and fried foods. Increases risk of heart disease, raises bad cholesterol (LDL - low-density lipoprotein), and lowers good cholesterol (HDL - high-density lipoproteins).
- **Saturated Fats:** Present in processed meats, dairy, and some snacks. Excess intake can lead to heart disease and obesity.
- **Added Sugars:** Common in sweets, drinks, and breakfast cereals. Linked to obesity, diabetes, tooth decay, and metabolic syndrome.
- **Sodium (Salt):** Used as a preservative and flavor enhancer in snacks, instant noodles, and processed foods. High sodium intake can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney problems.

##  Other Important Chemicals 

- **Antioxidants in Edible Oils (coconut oil, etc.):** TBHQ, BHA, BHT are added to prevent spoilage and rancidity. Sometimes, artificial flavors like ethyl methyl ketone or vanillin are added for aroma.
- **Cake and Food Flavour Chemicals:** Vanillin, ethyl vanillin, benzaldehyde, isoamyl acetate, methyl anthranilate (grape), diacetyl (buttery flavor), linalool, limonene, and other esters are used for smell and taste in cakes, biscuits, and sweets.
- **High Oleic Sunflower Oil:** A sunflower oil variant with more monounsaturated fats, used for frying and in processed foods for better shelf life and stability.
- **Inositol:** A vitamin-like substance (B8), used in energy drinks and infant formula for cell health and metabolism.
- **Taurine:** An amino acid, added to energy drinks and infant formula for neurological and muscle function.
- **Emulsifiers:** Help mix oil and water, improve texture (e.g., lecithin, polysorbate 80).
- **Thickeners/Stabilizers:** Improve texture and shelf life (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan).
- **Preservatives:** Extend shelf life (e.g., sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate).
- **Artificial Sweeteners:** Replace sugar (e.g., aspartame, sucralose).
- **Flavour Enhancers:** Boost taste (e.g., MSG, INS 627, INS 631).

##  What Are These Ingredients? 

- **Gluten:** Protein in wheat, barley, rye. Gives elasticity to dough. Not suitable for celiac/gluten intolerance.
- **Semolina:** Coarse wheat flour for pasta, noodles, bakery. Contains gluten.
- **Skimmed Milk Powder:** Milk with most fat removed, used in bakery, ice creams, infant formula.
- **Dehydrated Vegetables:** Dried vegetables for instant noodles, soups.
- **Hydrated Vegetable Protein:** Plant-based protein, used as meat substitute.
- **Extruded Rice:** Rice processed into shapes for snacks/cereals.
- **Peanut Oil:** Oil from peanuts, used in snacks/bakery; allergenic for some.
- **Milk Solids:** Concentrated milk components, used in sweets, ice creams, bakery.
- **Edible Vegetable Oil (High Oleic Sunflower Oil, Soy Oil):** Used for frying and as ingredient in processed foods.
- **Sodium Caseinate:** Milk protein, stabilizer in infant formula/ice creams.
- **Antioxidants** are natural or man-made substances that protect cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals. They help prevent oxidation, which can spoil fats and oils in foods. Antioxidants are used to extend shelf life and maintain freshness. Natural antioxidants (like vitamin E, vitamin C, and polyphenols) are found in nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables and are generally safe. Synthetic antioxidants (such as TBHQ, BHA, BHT) are commonly added to processed foods and may cause health concerns if consumed in excess, while natural antioxidants rarely cause issues when eaten as part of a balanced diet.

##  Where Are These Ingredients Mostly Used? 
![Food Categories](/images/year-2025/burger-icecream.jpg)

- **Packaged snacks:** Chips, namkeen, instant noodles, cookies, processed meats
- **Ice creams:** Stabilizers, thickeners, artificial colors/flavors, sweeteners
- **Soft drinks & juices:** Preservatives, acidity regulators, artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors
- **Bakery products:** Emulsifiers, thickeners, preservatives, artificial flavors

##  What Do INS and E Numbers Mean? 
- **INS:** International Numbering System for Food Additives, used globally to identify food additives.
- **E Numbers:** European system for food additives, similar to INS, used in ingredient lists.
- **Number Assignment:** Each additive is given a unique number (e.g., INS 319 for TBHQ, E260 for acetic acid/vinegar) for easy identification across countries.

##  How Numbers Are Given 
- Numbers are assigned by international food safety authorities (like Codex Alimentarius, EU, FSSAI).
- The same additive may have both INS and E numbers (e.g., INS 211 = E211 = Sodium Benzoate).
- Numbers are grouped by function: colors (100â€“199), preservatives (200â€“299), antioxidants (300â€“399), thickeners/stabilizers (400â€“499), sweeteners (900â€“999), etc.

:::tip
Always check ingredient labels and try to limit foods with multiple **synthetic additives**, **trans fats**, **saturated fats**, **added sugars**, and **sodium** â€” especially for children and sensitive individuals.
