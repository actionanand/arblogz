# Support Our Work

Thank you for reading our blog! This post demonstrates our new donation system that allows readers to support our content creation efforts.

## How It Works

Our donation system is **flexible and configurable** through page metadata:

- **Multiple Payment Methods**: PayPal, GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, Patreon, Open Collective
- **Regional Support**: Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe (India), Alipay, WeChat Pay (China)
- **Page-Specific Configuration**: Each page can have its own donation settings
- **Global Control**: Enable donations for all blog posts or control manually per page
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and QR code popups for scan-based payment methods

## Features

### üé® Beautiful Design
- Gradient backgrounds with subtle patterns
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Professional card-based layout
- Dark theme support

### üì± Mobile Optimized
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive layout
- Auto-hiding QR codes on mobile

### üîß Easy Configuration
You can enable donations on any page by adding frontmatter:

```yaml
---
showDonate: true
donateMessage: "Custom message here"
customDonate:
  enable: true
  paypalUrl: "your-paypal-url"
  githubSponsors: "your-username"
---
```

### üåç Global Support
- **PayPal** for international payments
- **GitHub Sponsors** for developer community
- **Buy Me a Coffee** for casual support
- **Ko-fi** for creator community
- **Patreon** for subscription-based support
- **Open Collective** for transparent funding
- **Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe** for Indian users
- **Alipay and WeChat Pay** for Chinese users

### üéõÔ∏è Smart Controls
- **Global Enable/Disable**: Turn donation system on/off site-wide
- **Blog-wide Default**: Enable donations on all blog posts by default
- **Manual Override**: Each page can override global settings
- **Priority System**: Manual settings always take precedence

## Configuration Examples

### Global Settings (in `src/consts.ts`):
```typescript
export const donate = {
  enable: true, // Master switch
  enableForAllBlogs: false, // Default for all blog posts
  // Payment configurations...
};
```

### Page-Level Control:
```yaml
# Enable donations (overrides global setting)
showDonate: true

# Disable donations (overrides global setting)  
showDonate: false

# Use global setting (enableForAllBlogs)
# showDonate: undefined (or omit the field)
```
